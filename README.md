# Gas Law Simulation Web Application

An interactive web-based simulator for exploring and learning gas laws through dynamic visualizations and practical problem-solving.

## Overview

This application provides an intuitive platform for students, educators, and enthusiasts to visualize gas law behaviors in real-time. Through interactive simulations, users can manipulate variables like pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of gas molecules to observe how these parameters affect each other according to various gas laws.

## Features

- **Interactive Simulations**: Visualize gas behavior with real-time molecule movement and collision dynamics
- **Multiple Gas Laws**: Explore all major gas laws:
  - Boyle's Law (P₁V₁ = P₂V₂)
  - Charles's Law (V₁/T₁ = V₂/T₂)
  - Gay-Lussac's Law (P₁/T₁ = P₂/T₂)
  - Avogadro's Law (V ∝ n)
  - Combined Gas Law (P₁V₁/T₁ = P₂V₂/T₂)
  - Ideal Gas Law (PV = nRT)
- **Parameter Control**: Adjust volume, pressure, temperature, and molecule count
- **Unit Conversions**: Switch between different units for pressure, volume, and temperature
- **Problem Sets**: Practice with sample problems for each gas law
- **Solution Sheets**: Get detailed solutions and explanations
- **Animated Transitions**: Smooth animations when changing between different states
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Walkthrough Tutorials**: Guided tours for learning how to use the application
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and explanations of gas law concepts
